*Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.*

* Sorting: Sorting the results of a benchmark testing different sorting algorithms.
* Convex hull: Honestly, wtf is that

*Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world
setting?*

Memory usage, computational complexity, predictabillity?(in real-time apps/os-es)

*Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and
limitations.*

Brain.
Linked list.

pros

* easy to add and remove elements in constant time
* good when you just need to iterate through all elements

cons

* no random access
* you need memory not only for the data, but for the pointers to the next elements(metadata?)

*How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar?
How are they different?*

They both solve practical problems, they can have many solutions, but it's not obvious and easy to invent
an optimal one

The shortest-path problem is P, the traveling-salesman is NP

*Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then
come up with one in which a solution that is “approximately” the best is good
enough.*
